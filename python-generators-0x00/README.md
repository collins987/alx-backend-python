# Python Generators â€“ ALX Backend Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving **live updates** and **memory-efficient computations**.

By leveraging Pythonâ€™s `yield` keyword, we implement generators that provide **iterative access** to data without loading everything into memory, improving performance in data-driven applications.
